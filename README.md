# Instagram Clone (Ruby on Rails)

## *** NOT YET COMPLETE ***

## Summary

My Week 8 challenge at Makers Academy was to build a clone of the Instagram app using Ruby on Rails.

This challenge was a good opportunity to consolidate what I had learned from the [Yelp clone project](https://github.com/ejbyne/rails-yelp) and Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails [tutorial](https://github.com/ejbyne/rails-twitter).

I have not yet completed the challenge, although the basic functionality is in place and the live version can be viewed [here](https://rails-instagram-clone.herokuapp.com). The app has a user authentication system, including the ability to sign in with Facebook, but still needs the additional work referred to in the "to do list" below.

## Features

- User can sign up, sign in and sign out (including the option to sign in with Facebook)
- User can upload pictures
- User can comment on pictures
- User can like pictures

## To do list

- User can only add a photo or a comment if they have signed in
- User can only delete a photo that they have added
- User can only edit or delete a comment they have added
- Add CSS/Bootstrap

## Technologies used

- ActiveRecord
- RSpec
