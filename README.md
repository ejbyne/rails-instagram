# Henrygram (Ruby on Rails Instagram Clone)

## Summary

My Week 8 challenge at Makers Academy was to build a clone of the Instagram app using Ruby on Rails.

This challenge was a good opportunity to consolidate what I had learned from the [Yelp clone project](https://github.com/ejbyne/rails-yelp) and Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails [tutorial](https://github.com/ejbyne/rails-twitter).

The app has evolved into somewhat of a homage to my beagle dog Henry, with the intention that it is used for my family and friends to share photos of him on the site!

The live version can be viewed [here](https://henrygram.herokuapp.com).

The app has a user authentication system, including the ability to sign in with Facebook.
